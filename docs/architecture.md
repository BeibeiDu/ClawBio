# 🦖 ClawBio Architecture

## Overview

ClawBio is a collection of modular AI agent skills for bioinformatics, designed around three principles: local-first execution, reproducible analysis, and composable workflows.

## Routing Logic

The Bio Orchestrator routes requests based on:

1. **File extension**: `.vcf` -> equity-scorer/vcf-annotator, `.fastq` -> seq-wrangler, etc.
2. **Keyword matching**: "diversity" -> equity-scorer, "structure" -> struct-predictor, etc.
3. **User intent**: Explicit skill names override automatic routing.
4. **Chaining**: Multi-step requests trigger sequential skill invocation with output piping.

## Skill Independence

Every skill works standalone. The Bio Orchestrator adds:
- Automatic routing (user does not need to know skill names)
- Multi-skill chaining (pipe output of one skill to the next)
- Unified reporting (combine results from multiple skills)
- Access to skill-defined reproducibility outputs where a routed skill implements them

A user can invoke any skill directly without the orchestrator.

## Data Flow

```
Input File(s)
    │
    ▼
Validation (file type, format, size checks)
    │
    ▼
Processing (skill-specific computation)
    │
    ▼
Results (tables, metrics, intermediate files)
    │
    ▼
Visualisation (matplotlib/seaborn figures)
    │
    ▼
Report Assembly (markdown + embedded figures)
    │
    ▼
Optional Reproducibility Export (helper-backed commands, environment, checksums)
```

## Privacy Model

ClawBio enforces a strict local-first privacy model:

- **No network calls** for data processing. All computation happens locally.
- **Optional network** only for: literature search (PubMed API), structure database queries (PDB/UniProt), and package installation.
- **Explicit consent** required before any data leaves the machine.
- **File access scoping**: Skills operate within the current working directory by default. Access to parent directories requires user confirmation.

## Reproducibility Contract

ClawBio's validated reproducibility contract is helper-backed rather than universal. For skills that use the shared reproducibility helpers, the output directory typically includes:

1. **`reproducibility/commands.sh`**: A replay command for the skill run without needing the original agent session.
2. **`reproducibility/environment.yml`**: A suggested Conda environment snapshot for the run.
3. **`reproducibility/checksums.sha256`**: SHA-256 hashes for selected output files.
4. **Optional extras**: Some skills may emit additional provenance files such as `runtime-lock.json` or other lock metadata.

Important boundaries:

- Reproducibility behavior can vary by skill.
- Replays may still require external tools or the original input files to be present locally.
- `analysis_log.md` is not a guaranteed output for every skill.
- Portable replay scripts reduce path friction, but they are not a blanket promise that every run will reproduce unchanged on every machine.

See `docs/reproducibility.md` for the user workflow and a concrete `multiqc-reporter` example.

## Skill Packaging

Each skill is a directory containing:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md          # Required: YAML frontmatter + markdown instructions
├── skill_name.py     # Optional: Python implementation
├── utils.py          # Optional: shared utilities
├── tests/            # Optional: test cases
│   └── test_skill.py
└── examples/         # Optional: example inputs/outputs
    ├── input.vcf
    └── expected_output.md
```

The SKILL.md is the primary artifact. The Python files are supporting code that the agent invokes via shell commands. This separation means:
- Skills can be reviewed as markdown (human-readable)
- Python code can be tested independently
- Skills work with any compatible agent platform, not just OpenClaw

## Integration with OpenBio

The existing [OpenBio skill](https://github.com/openclaw/skills) provides API access to:
- PDB (protein structures)
- UniProt (protein sequences and annotations)
- ChEMBL (bioactivity data)
- Pathway databases

ClawBio skills can call OpenBio for database lookups while keeping all computation local. For example, Struct Predictor might use OpenBio to fetch a reference structure from PDB, then run local AlphaFold for comparison.

## Extensibility

New skills follow the template at `templates/SKILL-TEMPLATE.md`. The Bio Orchestrator routing table is designed to be extended: add a new entry mapping file types or keywords to your skill, and the orchestrator routes to it automatically.
